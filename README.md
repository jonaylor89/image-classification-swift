# ImageClassification 

It's pretty much just KNN in swift. I want to depend less on python to do things so I rewrote a class project in swift. It uses the imfamous swift package PythonKit to read the csv of numpy data

It's amazing that I can speed days optimizing the speed of python code but get that same speed by writing shitty swift code in an afternoon
